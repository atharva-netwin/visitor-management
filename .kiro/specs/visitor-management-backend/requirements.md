# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Visitor Management Backend is a comprehensive server-side system that provides production-ready infrastructure for the visitor management mobile app. The backend supports dual-mode data storage (PostgreSQL for online, SQLite for offline), user authentication with self-registration, and enterprise-grade features necessary for a commercial, deployable application. The system is designed to handle multi-tenant scenarios, provide robust security, and scale for commercial use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account by providing basic information, so that I can start using the visitor management app immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides email, password, first name, and last name THEN the system SHALL create a new account and allow immediate login
2. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN password requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors
4. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return authentication token for immediate app access
5. WHEN user registration data is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want my data to be stored in a PostgreSQL database when online, so that my visitor information is centrally managed and accessible across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is online THEN the system SHALL store all visitor data directly in PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN visitor data is created online THEN the system SHALL return confirmation with unique database ID
3. WHEN the app syncs data THEN the system SHALL handle bulk operations efficiently
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes for app fallback
5. WHEN data is stored online THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want seamless offline-to-online data synchronization, so that visitor information captured offline is automatically uploaded when connectivity is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app comes online THEN the system SHALL accept batch uploads of offline visitor data
2. WHEN duplicate data is detected during sync THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using timestamp-based rules
3. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for retry logic
4. WHEN partial sync occurs THEN the system SHALL track which records were successfully processed
5. WHEN sync is complete THEN the system SHALL return updated record IDs for local database updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive API security and rate limiting, so that the backend can handle production traffic and prevent abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry-after headers
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and optionally block requests
4. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL validate and track usage per client
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays to prevent brute force attacks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging, monitoring, and health checks, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log structured data with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN health checks are requested THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and service status
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for monitoring tools
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed context for debugging
5. WHEN system resources are stressed THEN the system SHALL alert operators through configured channels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want data analytics and reporting capabilities, so that I can provide insights to customers about their visitor engagement and staff performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide visitor statistics by time periods, staff, and categories
2. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL support export formats (CSV, PDF, JSON)
3. WHEN dashboard data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time aggregated metrics
4. WHEN historical analysis is required THEN the system SHALL maintain data retention policies
5. WHEN custom queries are needed THEN the system SHALL provide flexible filtering and grouping options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation and testing tools, so that I can integrate with the backend and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
2. WHEN testing APIs THEN the system SHALL include interactive documentation with example requests
3. WHEN integration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide SDK examples for common platforms
4. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL offer detailed error responses with correlation IDs
5. WHEN API changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain versioning and backward compatibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want scalable deployment options with containerization, so that I can deploy the backend on various cloud platforms and scale based on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL provide Docker containers for all services
2. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
3. WHEN cloud deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL include configuration for AWS, Azure, and GCP
4. WHEN environment management is required THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
5. WHEN CI/CD is implemented THEN the system SHALL include automated testing and deployment pipelines

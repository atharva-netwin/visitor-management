# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Visitor Management App is a mobile application designed for event staff to efficiently capture and manage visitor information during events. The app provides secure authentication, OCR-powered data capture from business cards and event badges, visitor categorization, and performance tracking through a comprehensive dashboard. The system aims to streamline the lead generation process while maintaining data accuracy and user experience quality.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid username and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the dashboard
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain the session until logout or timeout
4. IF the user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated staff member, I want to view a dashboard showing my daily and monthly visitor registration metrics, so that I can track my performance and overall event success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the number of visitors registered today
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the number of visitors registered this month
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show a clear option to add new visitors
4. WHEN visitor data is updated THEN the dashboard metrics SHALL refresh automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to choose between scanning a business card or event badge when adding a new visitor, so that I can use the most appropriate data capture method based on what the visitor provides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Add New Visitor" THEN the system SHALL present two distinct capture method options
2. WHEN a user selects business card scanning THEN the system SHALL open the camera for card capture
3. WHEN a user selects event badge scanning THEN the system SHALL open the camera for badge capture
4. WHEN either method is selected THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for optimal scanning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to scan business cards using OCR technology, so that I can automatically extract visitor information and minimize manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user takes a picture of a business card THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract name, title, company, phone, email, and website
2. WHEN OCR processing completes THEN the system SHALL pre-fill the corresponding form fields with extracted data
3. WHEN OCR extraction fails or is incomplete THEN the system SHALL allow manual editing of all fields
4. WHEN the image quality is poor THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to retake the photo
5. WHEN OCR processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to scan event badges using OCR technology, so that I can capture visitor names and companies from badges when business cards are not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user takes a picture of an event badge THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract name and company information
2. WHEN badge OCR processing completes THEN the system SHALL pre-fill name and company fields in the form
3. WHEN badge scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL allow manual input of additional required information
4. WHEN badge OCR extraction is incomplete THEN the system SHALL highlight fields that need manual completion
5. WHEN the badge image is unclear THEN the system SHALL provide option to retake the photo

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to categorize visitor interests and add contextual notes, so that I can provide relevant information for effective follow-up after the event.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor form is displayed THEN the system SHALL include interest categorization options (LOS, LMS, Reconciliation Software, CBS, API Portal)
2. WHEN categorizing interests THEN the system SHALL allow multiple selections from the available options
3. WHEN adding visitor information THEN the system SHALL provide a notes section for additional comments
4. WHEN saving visitor data THEN the system SHALL require at least one interest category to be selected
5. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight missing or invalid fields

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want all captured visitor information to be securely stored with an intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently manage data while engaging with visitors without interrupting conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visitor information is submitted THEN the system SHALL securely store all data in a structured database
2. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive interface that minimizes navigation complexity
3. WHEN data entry is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow quick switching between fields and functions
4. WHEN visitor data is saved THEN the system SHALL provide immediate confirmation and return to the main capture flow
5. WHEN the app is used during conversations THEN the system SHALL support one-handed operation where possible
6. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache data locally and sync when connection is restored
